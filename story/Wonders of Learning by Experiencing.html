				<article class="story-content">
					<p>The joy of learning by seeing and doing was revealed most wonderfully to me by a group of 5-8 year olds. At the heart of the experience was the way these young children looked at everything around them with wonder and a desire to explore. These children live and study in a private, residential school where most of the students are from affluent, urban backgrounds. The school is located in a rural community about 20 kms from the nearest town.</p>
					<p>I periodically engaged with this group of children as part of their Environmental Studies or EVS class. During one such session, we began exploring the question: Where does the milk that we drink, come from? The community where the children and I lived buys milk from a nearby village co-operative run by a group of small and marginal farmers. We decided to visit the co-operative to trace the route that milk takes from its source, the cow, to our homes.</p>
					<p><em>We reached the cooperative, as planned, at the time when they were collecting milk from various farmers.&nbsp; The curious children&nbsp;walked around peering into milk containers that the farmers were holding. Their excitement was palpable with shouts of &ldquo;fresh&nbsp;milk is so white and frothy! I feel like drinking it straight from the bucket!&rdquo; &ldquo;Can we drink it straight from the bucket?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why does milk look different when we drink it at home?&rdquo; Some of the children had dashed down the street and were shouting &ldquo;Look everybody on this road is milking cows at the same time!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wow, look at the speed with which the milk is coming out of this cow. The milk from the other cow is slower. Why is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;There are many different coloured cows. Some are brown, black and white, grey, white. </em></p>
					<p><strong>&ldquo;Why are they coloured differently?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do some cows have horns and others don&rsquo;t? &ldquo;This cow is eating something while the lady is milking it. What is it eating?&rdquo;</strong></p>
					<p>The farmers and I tried answering each question from which the milk story slowly began unfolding seemingly in a fragmented fashion. The narrative did not follow&nbsp;the stepwise journey from the cow to our table: starting from the cow, the milking activity, to the cooperative collection centre and from there&nbsp;to the central kitchen of the school&nbsp;where the children and I lived. The fact that there would be questions around the colour of cows, speed of milking, what they eat etc., did not occur to me. I was struggling with several things: how does one explain that different colours mean different breeds, what are breeds, some breeds have horns, and others do not etc. The challenge here was to simplify these ideas for 5-8 years old without deflecting the questions.</p>
					<p>We then sat down in the village and over several glasses of warm, sweet milk, tried to piece together the story of the milk based on what they had seen and understood. What emerged was a rich and textured account. It became clear&nbsp;that our story was not merely about tracking the milk from the cow to the table. We learnt about breeds (there are different types of cows just as there are different types of dogs and cats), difference between indigenous and exotic (imported from the Netherlands, Denmark etc.) breeds of cattle, why conserving local breeds is important, raw milk vs pasteurised milk, the art of milking a cow, diet of cows, how farmers&rsquo; children help their parents while studying in school etc.</p>
					<blockquote>
					    <p>An interesting pedagogical experience emerged: learning through immersion in a real-life situation an open-ended exploration led by the young children and not the teacher. The children&rsquo;s sense of wonder, keen observation and uninhibited way of asking questions allowed them to learn in a way that would not have been possible in any classroom or audio-visual aided environment.
					    </p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>When planning this activity I had done so with a pre-conceived idea of what 5-8 year olds could comprehend which had led to the struggle I had experienced when the children were asking seemingly diverse questions. If we had explored this question sitting in a classroom or in a structured manner as I had planned to we would have probably traced the journey from the cow to the table by drawing a classic milk supply chain diagram. How lifeless that would have been!
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>The challenge many of us educators face is to keep this sense of wonder and newness alive in children as they grow and learn. With a few exceptions most young people lose this ability by the time they reach puberty.</p>
					<p>It is also the time when our mainstream education system begins to complicate the learning process. The number of subjects they have to study increases, there are performance related expectations around exams and later around career choices. As educators we also seem to get drawn into this time-bound &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; style of functioning: moving from one exam or test to the next and focussing on ticking the boxes or rather topics to be covered in the curriculum.&nbsp; To keep the joy of learning alive and to equip young people with skills that will keep learning alive all through their life it is critical that we integrate real-life experiences in their learning programme.</p>
