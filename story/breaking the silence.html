					<p>It began to rain heavily by the time I reached school. Many teachers were late that morning. The classrooms were brimming with enthusiasm as usual. After a quick glance at the morning duty chart – and realising that several teachers were still on their way – I decided to manage two classrooms of the primary wing. While I usually do not teach class 3, that day I decided to spend 15 minutes with them. Fifteen life-altering minutes.</p>

					<p>I wrote the mathematical table of two on the board and asked the students to read it aloud. The frail, little girl on the last bench caught my eye. After a few minutes, the students pointed towards her complaining that <em>Chirengi</em> was not reading out loud. Chirengi’s unusual demeanour did not make her feel like “a part of the class”. Her hair was knotted and she was shabbily dressed. She was frequently inhaling air to stop the flow of mucus.</p>

					<blockquote>“<em>Come here</em>,” I said as I asked her to come on the first bench. The girl refused straight away.</blockquote>

					<p>At that moment, I reacted like any other conventional teacher would have. Her reaction angered me and I pulled her to read out the table. Meanwhile, the students around added to her woes as they told me how <em>Chirengi </em>disobeyed whenever any teacher asked her to do some work. <em>Chirengi</em> murmured in her own language, and the students told me that she was saying that she would complain to her mother about the teasing incident. Chirengi did not utter a word and started crying.</p>

					<p>Pointing to ‘2’ on the board, I calmly told her, “Do you know what this is?” She stood silently, eyes brimming with tears, and rubbing them with her little fingers. She went on breathing deep and wiping her tears with the shirt cuffs. As other students sat silently on their benches apprehending the punishment, I gently asked her to go back to her seat.</p>

					<p>As a teacher, it felt disturbing to start the day with such an incident.</p>

					<p>The next day, when I found out about <em>Chirengi’s </em>background, it shook me even more. Chirengi was from a refugee group living in the interior forests of Arunachal Pradesh. Lohit district, the place where my school is located, has a large population of displaced <em>Chakma </em>refugees. Chirengi was a Chakma refugee, residing in the dense forests, outside the Arunachali tribal villages. Due to political hostility, the <em>Chakmas</em> have little social interaction with the major local communities, except during weekly markets, where they bring the vegetables and fruits they grow in their settlements in the forests to sell. Till recently most of these settlements had no schools, anganwadis, or health clinics.</p>

					<blockquote>I knew what I was doing next. As a teacher, we all encounter moments when the children need us to step beyond the boundaries of the classroom. I met Chirengi after school and she opened up to me about the difficulties she faced.</blockquote>

					<p>Chirengi lived with other Chakma children in the forest, which is about 6-7 kms from the school. Some days, she would come without eating breakfast because the morning school assembly starts at 9.15 am and to reach school, she had to start at 6.30 a.m. The emotional hostility that her family faced as <em>Chakma </em>refugees translated into the little girl’s everyday life. Chirengi’s academic records were also reflecting that her performance had been deteriorating.</p>

					<p>I began to contextualise the situation <em>Chirengi</em> came from. Her story was a call for me to reflect on making the classroom a socially, culturally and linguistically inclusive space. A need that was more strictly felt in rural schools such as this one!</p>

					<p>A few days later, there was a notification in the school asking teachers to conduct remedial classes for girls who were scoring below 33 per cent in mathematics. I leaped onto the opportunity to engage frequently with Chirengi. Other than aids such as extra teaching time and free notebooks, there was something else at hand that Chirengi needed: an emotional chord.</p>

					<p>The first thing I did was make her comfortable. I told her to not hesitate to speak – even if the answer is wrong. The bond we had begun to share brought a change in the way Chirengi responded to situations. The smile on her face was also an indication of the confidence and comfort in her personality. She also began to talk with other students in class – and everyday incidences like sharing food and laughter were a remarkable shift.</p>

					<p>As a teacher, I also realised that change has to start from my own role. On seeing clumsy handwriting or incomplete homework, I did not rebuke her, but encouraged her to read again and again. Whenever she stopped, I helped her. I said, “Chirengi, feel free to ask me if you do not know any number.” Within a week, she was freely mingling with me and the other students. Of course, there was a behavioural shift from the other students as well as I had to go an extra mile to engage other students to help her.</p>

					<p>The week of remedial classes was over – but Chirengi’s journey had just begun! She would greet several teachers with ‘good morning’. She would come during lunch to tell me about her friends. Even as the change was not instant, she began to show improvement in academic performance. This had to be done in coordination with other teachers.</p>

					<p>By the end of the session, I realised the remedial classes were not meant for Chirengi, it was meant for teachers like me. There may be many such Chirengis, who cannot keep pace academically with other students due to linguistic and social hurdles. But as teachers, the onus is on us – to strike an affable equation with every single student – from the first bench to the last bench. Sometimes, it may be hard, but never impossible.</p>
