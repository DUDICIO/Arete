					<p>A couple of years ago, WasteLess from Auroville came to visit my school, Rishi Valley. They came to talk to us about waste management, conduct an audit of our waste system, and share a curriculum called Garbology 101. The curriculum is quite a massive tome. It covers some 350 pages of both lesson plans and guidance for teachers. Each potential lesson is colour coded with symbols indicating which level the exercise is best for as well as what tools you&rsquo;ll need and how much class time it will take.</p>
					
					<p>Although I had noticed the trash problem around the country, I certainly didn&rsquo;t consider it much on my campus as it is quite a bubble, one that is isolated from the surrounding villages in terms of services and privileges. What lured me into this problem on campus and more generally, perhaps, is the focus of WasteLess&rsquo; curriculum: turning off the tap. In other words, just as you would turn off the tap if you saw the faucet left on, why not get to the root of the problem with trash. That root is consumption.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Children in India (as well as adults!) are increasingly prone to give into their mindless desires, purchases, and munching. This type of consumption, often done without any real thought given to whether or not one needs it or is hungry, is creating a dangerous precedent in India and is largely responsible for changing the waste-scape around the country.</strong></p>
					
					<p>The adults and teenagers I talked to about this would nod their heads in agreement, but then go back to buying their biscuits in multi-layer foil packaging and not think twice about the damage they were doing to their bodies by eating harmful &ldquo;edible food-like substances&rdquo; (as Michael Pollan calls it) or to the planet by littering it with non-recyclable materials. But the youngest children at my school--the fourth standard batch--seemed the most amenable to thinking twice about these issues and so I resolved to teach them Garbology 101.</p>
					
					<p><strong>The Garbology curriculum is broken down into five units: Waste, Resource Conservation, Avoidance &amp; Reduction, Conscious Consumerism, and Systems Change.</strong> Each one builds on the other and on the whole the curriculum is interdisciplinary in the best sense of the word. Elements of science, humanities, and social science blend in many of the lesson plans. All such concepts are neatly embedded into the lesson and integrated seamlessly.</p>

					<p>After starting the first lesson, which was an introduction to trash and what we&rsquo;d be doing over the course of the year, <strong>I began the year with a lesson that illustrates the child&rsquo;s relationship to trash. They were all asked to get a piece of their own garbage from home</strong>. Most brought biscuit and candy wrappers, but others brought more unusual items; one girl brought a painting that she had made but didn&rsquo;t like any more, one had a glass bottle, and one a refillable plastic pen. This first exercise helped the students see that there was value in some of these items and that some could be reused. It also illustrated quite clearly what was of little value, which was also what made up the bulk of the trash. Because this curriculum is undergirded by the idea that we need to cut down on what we consume, this first lesson helped students to develop awareness around that. An additional homework assignment where they had to keep a log of all that they consumed or used &nbsp;in a week helped bring this home even further, especially when they could also see how much would wind up in a trash bin shortly thereafter.</p>
					
					<p>As a counterpoint to all that we humans consume and throw out, another early and crucial lesson for the children is composting.</p>
					
					<p>Because my school (Rishi Valley School, Andhra Pradesh) has an estate we are able to see how it&rsquo;s done on a large scale and also on a small scale as most of the hostels are also practising composting. I took the children to the estate for a tour so they could learn how it&rsquo;s done from the experts. They had strong tactile experiences feeling the heat beneath the surface where the food was getting broken down. They got to play with cow dung and microorganisms that are used to speed up the process. Afterwards I had them participate in the Creative Composters assignment from Garbology. In this lesson, students need to explore nature around them to see how composting happens naturally. They observe what happens underneath a mossy rock or a pile of leaves to see how nature decomposes without any help from us. <strong>This exercise also helps the children learn about what belongs in the wet waste bin and what belongs in the dry waste bins. </strong></p>
					
					<p>Many of these lessons took us to various parts of campus where we explored what we do with waste. On one such occasion we had a scavenger hunt where the children were required to find different pieces of waste on a list--the team who finds all of those items first wins! During this game we noticed that there are a number of brick-lined pits behind hostels filled with garbage. Although at one point these were intended to be used as compost pits, they never seem to have been used for that purpose. Instead, it was a smelly mixture of organic and inorganic waste. This is when some of the older children at school got involved.</p>
					
					<p>We have a fieldwork activity every day during which ninth through twelfth standard students participate in various activities that involve getting their hands dirty, like digging compost pits. Having been recently inspired by the Ugly Indian I thought it would be interesting to try such a tactic out on campus. I screened the Ugly Indian&rsquo;s TED talk during assembly and then invited students and teachers to join in an Ugly Indian campaign. For the remainder of the year, during fieldwork, but also during free time, we managed to clear out at least six of these pits, all of which are at least five feet deep. Although it smelled atrocious and was often disgustingly dirty with all sorts of creatures crawling around in the muck, the students and the few teachers who joined really got their hands dirty. It was an incredible lesson, too, because we saw what we throw away: credit cards, silverware from the dining hall, Birkenstock shoes and all sorts of chappals, paintings, medicine that hasn&rsquo;t expired or been used, bangles, hair pins, badminton rackets, cooking supplies, pens, nail polish--you name it, we found it. It was a bit like an anthropological dig: we were uprooting the nature and culture of our community.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Nothing says as much about a community as what they throw away. At least that was the lesson we all learned.</strong></p>
					
					<p>And so we started a collection. One student in particular, Pankti Patel, a twelfth standard art student who was involved from day one with this garbage clean up, helped to collect the more beautiful items. After we had a sizeable stash, we met with a group of other interested students and decided to create an art installation to showcase what we throw away at school. The piece would take the form of a tree--like the trees we planted in the place where these brick-lined garbage pits used to be. And around the base of the tree would be glass bottles planted with beans, which would eventually climb up the tree and take over. Ultimately, this project captivated not only the senior students, but also the junior-most ones. While watching Pankti work on her tree week after week, students had conversations about what they saw emerging.</p>
					
					<p>Most of the younger students in Garbology class, who were learning about how to identify organic objects from inorganic ones began to have an increased appreciation for the natural world and maintaining it. We also learned about the lives of ragpickers and scrap dealers by reading stories such as Gita Wolf&rsquo;s <em>Trashed!</em> (a story that they still seem to recall quite fondly and reread) or about the harmful role of plastics by reading the story in the Garbology curriculum about Jala the loggerhead sea turtle whose habitat is becoming destroyed because of human consumption of plastic. Over the holidays students had to draw the life cycle of a product to consider what natural resources it&rsquo;s made of and where it goes when no one has any use for it any longer. <strong>This was also tied to learning how to discern between what one needs and what one wants.&nbsp;</strong></p>
					<div class="panel teacher-tip">
						<div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Project</strong></p><p>The year culminated with two projects. One came directly from the children. They wanted to write letters to the biscuit manufacturers to see whether or not they&rsquo;d be willing to change their packaging. So they all wrote letters to Parle and even received a response in return, albeit not one they were pleased with. They also participated in a play that I wrote at the end of the year to highlight the particular problems with waste that we encounter on campus. The hope was that this would encourage the older students and the grownups to join in this campaign to clean up campus, to be more conscious of their consumer behaviour, and to ultimately avoid and reduce what they yearn for and purchase.</p>
						
						<p><strong>This batch of students was clearly touched by this year-long focus on garbage, something that they never seemed to grow bored with.</strong> Indeed, they show their ongoing interest in it by continuing to help with composting on the weekends, alerting me to problems with packaging, and complaining about the new batch of fourth standard students who don&rsquo;t yet know how to segregate their waste properly. <strong>My hope is that by reaching the smallest and youngest batch of students, we can transform the culture of school by reshaping how we looking at consumption and waste. It may be a long process, but behavioural change requires that.</strong> If we want to clean up our communities in India and step outside the &ldquo;out of mind/ out of sight&rdquo; framework that we all seem to live in, adopting this Garbology 101 curriculum is the best, easiest, and liveliest way one can imagine doing so.</p>
